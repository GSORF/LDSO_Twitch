# Dependencies / License

This repository is about to recreate the original code base of Direct Sparse Odometry with Loop Closure (LDSO) from TUM, therefore credit is given to the awesome implementation from them:

Please, if you want a fully working Visual SLAM, use the original LDSO and not the version I am working on!
